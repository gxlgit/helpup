### About
A full-stack app to help connect pop-up volunteer projects with volunteers.

### How to use
Organizations and individuals will signup and create a profile.  Once logged in they can see, post, update, and delete all helpUp volunteer opportunities.  Only the creator of the helpUp can edit it in any way, everyone else can see the details and Take Part in the helpUp.  Users can update their profile by adding extra information and a photo.  If the user decides to delete their profile, then any jobs they have created will also be removed. 

### Future fixes
On removing profile delete volunteer from any opportunities they are taking part in
+ more validation on the forms
  + users can't enter a date in the past
+ a location to the volunteer opportunity
+ a map showing the location
+ a user thumbnail on the navbar after login
+ separate accounts for organizations
